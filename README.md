# Welcome to my portfolio!

Hi! This is my portfolio where I have been adding personal projects which apply the data science and analytical skills that I have been picking up during my graduate programme at the University of Edinburgh and from my independent study.

In the items in this repo, you can find my notebooks and outputs on analysese and visualisations using Python, SQL, and Tableau / Power BI. I am highly passionate about the power of powerful analytical tools to gain business insights â€“ and I am looking forward to adding more items here as I continue to build my skills in this area.

Thank you!

Rajesh
